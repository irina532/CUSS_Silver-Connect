# **SilverConnect**

Welcome to SilverConnect,connecting generation ,expanding happiness.
A non-profile voluntierized organization to listen to our senior citizens. we
are here to provide them the little thing that brings smile to them.
 
# Chapter 1 - INTRODUCTION <br>
This project aims to provide invaluable support and assistance to
residents of old age homes through a technology-driven approach. Our
initiative focuses on developing a system that integrates various technologies to enhance the overall quality of life for elderly individuals
with the help of young digital natives .The proposed project encompasses a range of services tailored to the unique needs of the elderly residents, For Example, amusement, medication,health monitoring and
much more.

**Description on the topic:** <br>
The targeted project is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to facilitate the connection between elderly individuals seeking assistance. Here, the
service providers are offering various services.The system is aimed to focus
on user friendly interaction and efficient management of profiles, booking
and transaction of points


**Problem Definition:**<br>
It is not just prisoners who live in solitary confinements, it is the people
in their advanced age too. Some of them lose their families and in some
cases, their families lose them. But in both cases, they become so lonely that
sometimes, the loneliness becomes more painful then arthritis.
The most precious thing can be given to them is our time, making them
feel like home. With this motive , we are here with ‚ÄúSilverConnect‚Äù, a nonprofit volunteered organization to listen to our senior citizens. We are here
to provide them little things to bring smile to them.

**Objectives:**<br>
-> **Primary objective**<br>
‚Ä¢To gain practical experience by modeling a software based on real world problem. <br>
‚Ä¢To understand how to work on Front-end (HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT) and Back-end (MySQL,PHP) by using server(XAMPP).

-> **Secondary objective** <br>
‚Ä¢To develop an application that connects two types of users: the elderly seeking services and the providers who offer them.<br>
‚Ä¢to remove their loneliness and provide them some sort of amusement.<br>
‚Ä¢To focus on user friendly interaction and efficient management of profiles, booking
and transaction of points.<br>
‚Ä¢To provide details information about services. <br>

**Hardware and software tools:**<br>
‚öôÔ∏è	**Hardware Requirements:**<br>
o	Computer with either Intel Pentium processor or AMD processor.<br>
o	1GB+ DDR RAM<br>
o	40GB hard disk drive<br>


üíª	**Software Requirements:**<br>
o	Windows/ MacOS/ Linux operating system.<br>
o	JRE and JDK.<br>
o	MySQL server (WAMP or XAMPP or any)<br>
o	Visual Studio Code.<br>

# Chapter 2 - DESIGN<br>
Database Design is a collection of processes that facilitate the designing, development, implementation and maintenance of enterprise data management systems.<br>
It helps produce database systems:<br>
o	That meet the requirements of the users<br>
o	Have high performance.<br><br>

**Architecture Description** <br>
The design of a DBMS depends on its architecture. It can be centralized or decentralized or hierarchical. The architecture of a DBMS can be seen as either single tier or multi-tier.<br><br>

                                    Fig 2: ER Diagram

An entity‚Äìrelationship model describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge . It is composed of entity types and specifies relationships that can exist between instances of those entity types.
 
**Relational Schema Diagram**

                                      Fig 3: Relational Schema 
Relational schema is a collection of meta-data. Database schema describes the structure and constraints of data representing in a particular domain.

# Chapter 3 - IMPLEMENTATION <br>
**Description on Implementation**<br>
The goal of this application is to provide invaluable support and assistance to
residents of old age homes through a technology-driven approach. <br><br>
**List of modules:**<br>
o	Landing page<br>
o	Home page<br>
o	login & register pages<br>
o	Bookings<br>
o	Services<br>
o	Admin page<br>
o	User/Settings<br>
o	Emailing<br>


# Chapter 4 - Result and Discussion<br>
By using MySQL commands and its database this website tends to store all the data received from the users including bookings and services detail and the transaction of points are all in this data base. This website allows the user to book for services,discard or gain points through bookings. It also provides  User-friendly Interface,Data Privacy . By using xampp server these database commands are easily initiated into the database and the ER diagram with relational schema diagrams helps us to make the structure of the database faster and it was easier to make them understand the needs of the website.<br>


# CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE SCOPE
**Conclusion:**<br>
At this very ending, we can confirm that the target of our project was to
provide services to elderly by young people to create a connection between
generations. We created this system observing the people who need some
extra care in their advanced age and a bunch of enthusiastic young adults
who are willing to spend their leisure doing this noble act. Our developed
solution is doing pretty much as planned.<br><br>
**Future Work:**<br>
Some more ideas came to our mind while working on it for betterment. We
will try to make sure to include them in future updates. These are :<br>
‚Ä¢ This is specific location based program. Our aim is to reduce this
limitation and make it available for elderly people of different location
of the country.<br>
‚Ä¢ We have a little number of services. We will update the system in a
way that a provider can offer a service from his own, not from only
specified one.<br>
‚Ä¢ There will be some transaction system and paid services in upcoming
updates so that it can even be used commercially.<br>
